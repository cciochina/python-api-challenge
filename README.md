For part I, some observable trends based on the data:
 - as we get closer to the latitude 0 (closer to the Ecuator), the temperatures are higher.
 - most of the cities have higher humidity rather then lower humidity.
 - We do not see a significant difference in cloudiness based on latitude.
 - Most of the cities have a lower rate of wind speed rather than a higher rate.

Linear Regression:
 - Northern Hemisphere - Max Temp vs. Latitude Linear Regression: The correlation r value indicated a strong negative correlation between the MaxTemp and the latitude. 
 - Southern Hemisphere - Max Temp vs. Latitude Linear Regression: The r correlation value indicated a strong positive correlation between the  MaxTemp and the latidude. 
 - Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Linear Regression: The r correlation value indicates a very weak, sligthly positive association between humidity and latitude.  
 - Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Linear Regression: The r correlation value indicates a very weak, sligthly negative association between humidity and latitude.  
 - Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Linear Regression: The r correlation value indicates a very weak negative association between cloudiness and latitude in the Northern Hemisphere.  
 - Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Linear Regression: The r correlation value indicates a weak positive association between cloudiness and latitude in the Southern Hemisphere.
 - Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude Linear Regression: The r correlation value indicates a weak negative association between  Wind Speed and latitude in the Northern Hemisphere
 - Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude Linear Regression: The r correlation value indicates a negative association between  Wind Speed and latitude in the Southern Hemisphere
