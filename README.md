For part I, some observable trends based on the data:
 - as we get closer to the latitude 0 (closer to the Ecuator), the temperatures are higher.
 - most of the cities have higher humidity rather then lower humidity.
 - We do not see a significant difference in cloudiness based on latitude.
 - Most of the cities have a lower rate of wind speed rather than a higher rate.
